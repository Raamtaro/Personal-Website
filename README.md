Hey there,

I'm Raam. This is the source code for my developer portfolio. You can run it locally by:

1. Cloning this repo

2. cd to `Personal-Website` in your terminal or shell and then run `npm install`

3. Run `npm install` and then copy-paste `http://localhost:5173/` into your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, ...)

Or feel free to view it at: **REPLACE WITH URL**

This is a work in progress - feel free to check back in occasionally for new projects or updates.

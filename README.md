# Personal-Website

Hey there,

I'm Raam. This is the source code for my developer portfolio. You can run it locally by:

1. Cloning this repo

2. cd to `Personal-Website` in your terminal or shell and then run `npm install`

3. Run `npm install` and then copy-paste `http://localhost:5173/` into your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, ...)

Or feel free to view it at: **REPLACE WITH URL**

This is a work in progress - feel free to check back in occasionally for new projects or updates.

**PLEASE READ**
If you decide to use my project as a template for your own, or build upon it, a few things:

1. Thank you - that's a huge compliment!
2. I'd appreciate a shout out in the readME, or somewhere within your project.
3. Please fork the repo instead of directly cloning it. 
4. Please submit issues if you see anything in the base template that seems buggy or poorly designed.
